# GPT BAD-IDEAâ„¢

A system-wide copilot experiment.

ChatGPT (and its cousins) cannot domineer the world yet. Here's why:

1. ChatGPT cannot think; it doesn't have a chain of thought like we do. Since
   it's a transformer, the only thing it can do is to give one response to each
   of your requests (or say, generate text according to input).
2. ChatGPT cannot interact with the environment; it totally depends on the user
   for input and only has an impact on the user's mind, as the output. Although,
   plugins now can mitigate this "limitation". But plugins are/can be carefully
   designed to provide selective access to the outside world such as the
   internet. Considering the above, we can see that since there is no feedback
   mechanism, it cannot improve on its own.
3. ChatGPT is amnesiac; unless you fine tune it, send it the previous
   conversations or the information extracted from them, ChatGPT doesn't
   remember anything and will base its answers purely on what it has already
   been trained on. And considering the above points we can see that ChatGPT
   cannot evolve on its own.
4. ChatGPT is mostly text-based. Although it now has a(n unstable) structured
   output mode, multi-model generative capabilities, and plugin support, the
   parts that process different types of information are not intricately
   interconnected like in a brain.
5. ChatGPT is stupider than the average man. Although GPT-4 can get to the 99th
   percentile in The USA Biology Olympiad, which is darn impressive, this is
   mostly "knowledge" rather than "intelligence"; ChatGPT is somewhat
   intelligent but it lacks some... common sense.

I can think of one way to make god-like AI, and I can explain that in one word.
But this is not it. This is merely another attempt similar to countless others
like AutoGPT or AgentGPT to circumvent the limitations using popular workarounds
written in TypeScript (because everything I see is python).
